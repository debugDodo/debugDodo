## âœ¨ About Me

I'm a student at the computer science school in Bern and I make games and small applications in my free time  
I haven't been absent since I created my Github account in 2021, I only got into versioning at the start of  
my time studying at gibb and while there all of my projects were hosted in their GitLab.  
But now that I have finally decided on a username I'll be uploading my future projects onto here.
